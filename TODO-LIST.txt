Conclusion



Talk about meta-programming (i don't want to solve)
Create simple refactoring to beginner users
create to a simple IDE like DrRacket

Related work
Talk about what exist for static and object oriented languages such as Java/C# and the functionalities their IDE's have, eclipse, netbeans, inteliJ and visual studio

Talk about stuff related to dynamic languages, what exist and is done, what is missing.
Griswold (scheme/drracket)
Smaltalk
python
Javascript

And check what is helpful to the user and is missing for the dynamic languages.

Table ( 1 or 2 tables)
Compare dynamic vs Static and between dynamic languages

Comment what is missing to dynamic languages.

comparing keys, dynamic/static, multi-languages, simple?, how it's done, number of refactoring/ refactoring coverage, possibility to create new?, etc

Architecture:

Explain the idea that is create a DrRacket prototype and use the functionalities that DrRacket gives and are useful to create refactoring that are interesting to the user, especially the beginner user.

Conclusion:
Wrap up everything and say that I'm awesome.
