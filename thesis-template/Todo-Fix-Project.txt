[FIXME]Should inexperienced programmers do refactoring at all?

Abstract:
[FIXME]Relationship not clear between inexperienced programmers and dynamic languages.

[FIXME]How much refactoring is indeed done in those contexts?
(dynamic languages in learning courses)

[FIXME]How much refactoring is done in industrial contexts for dynamic languages?

Introduction:
[TODO]Define basic block

[FIXME]: E.g. PHP is object oriented and there is no refactoring tools.

[FIXME] common tool.

[FIXME] The importance of refactoring is not clear when the context is teaching.
(is this the starting point?) [TODO] EXPLAIN this very clearly!

[Scietific community, explain] -> not true in general!!
[FIXME] What is a pedagogic environmnet.

[TODO] EXPLAIN clearly the starting point.

OBjectives:
[FIXME] What is a pedagogic environment??? [not sure]
[FIXME] in what way is eclipse not pedagogic
in addition to the users what is the level of complexity associated with
the code being refactored.

3.1
[FIXME] exists combination refactoring
[Already discussed, maybe explain better]
'If software [missing word ]is not being [missing word] how
are you going to evaluate your results'

3.3.
[FIXME] (!!!) There is no consensual definition for what bheavior preservation

3.4 [FIXME] How experienced were the people doing the refactoring
[FIXME] Relevance about finding out more aobut the program. regarting refactoring
[FIXME] what does mean a lot of work keeping the initial representation
[FIXME] Yet this documentation may be crucial for the
 refactoring process itself

 3.5.2 [FIXME] unreadable figure (fig 1)
 [FIXME] references and "..."
3.5.4
[FIXME] Ate porque uma ferramenta automatica nao e' usada da mesma forma para
 os outros 2 tipos
[FIXME] 'Semi-automatica may be the best to teach'
 [FIXME] change order of tables.
 4.1 [FIXME] criteria for better uses refactoring tools.
[FIXME] propostion of non-Java developers
[TODO] Explain why the usage of the refactorings is different

 4.2 [FIXME] table should mark most used ones
 [FIXME] Comparassion between languages
 4.4 [FIXME] Problems
 4.4.1 undo
 [FIXME] isto parecem conclusoes gerais sobre refactorizacao (remove?)
 4.4.2 [FIXME] Does not explain how it works.
 [FIXME] What is "right semantic"
 4.5 [FIXME] a lot of stuff
 [FIXME] Scope of automated refactoring
 [FIXME] remove randoop
 [TODO] Who does usually benefit from automated refactoring?
[FIXME] Scope of automated refactoring??

 4.6
 [FIXME] Remove repeated information/rewrite
 [FIXME] rewrite to explain better.
[FIXME] They may  not exist: dynamic bindings 

 4.7
 [FIXME] rewrite intro

4.7.1
[FIXME] [important? argument?] [missing word] [missing word] operation?
4.7.2
[FIXME] limitation of complexity
[FIXME] So, it represents requires running the program  (Yes it requires)


4.9.1
[FIXME] What languages
[FIXME] You end up not describing anything relevant about FAMIX

4.9.2
[FIXME] Requirements
results
more info??

4.10
[FIXME] are any at all? (refactoring tools for dynamic languages adequeate for inexperienced users)
[FIXME] connection (with the previous sentense) is not [missing word] (basically it does not make any sense)

5
[FIXME] (again) how does eclipse fail at being a pedagogic environment (it may not be, but you have to be precise)
[FIXME] Explain better why not python (it's much more useful)

5.1.2
[FIXME] A well known problem with refactoring and inexperienced users: they will trought(?? nao confirmam??) wrong results
5.2.
[FIXME] simpli statetement add details more details, details for everyone!!

6
[FIXME] not good [misisng word]
[FIXME] explain better what does "theoretical languages and nor for languages actually used" mean
