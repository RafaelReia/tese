Dynamic languages are becoming popular, specially among inexperienced programmers. 
However, refactoring tools for dynamic languages have less functionality when compared with refactoring tools for static languages, because they have less information at compile time, particularly type information.
The lack of refactoring tools for a language forces the programmer to do tedious and error prone work to improve the quality of the software. 
This is even worse for inexperienced users, because it requires specific knowledge about the language making it even more error prone.
Due to the increasing popularity of dynamic languages and because of their utility for teaching introductory courses, the need for refactoring tools for dynamic languages is now evident.
This paper proposes the creation of a refactoring tool adequate for inexperienced users.
