Dynamic languages are becoming popular, specially among unexperienced programmers. 
However, the refactoring tools for dynamic languages have less functionality when compared with refactoring tools for static languages, because they have less information in compile time, namely the type's information, that is only available during runtime.
The lack of refactoring tools for a language makes the programmer do tedious and error prone work to improve the quality of the software. 
This is even worst for unexperienced users, because it requires specific knowledge about the language.
Consequently making it even more error prone.
Due to the lack of refactoring tools for dynamic languages, their increasing popularity, and because of their utility when teaching introductory courses, the need for refactoring tools for dynamic languages grows.
This paper proposes a creation of a refactoring tool adequate with unexperienced users.
