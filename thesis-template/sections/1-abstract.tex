Dynamic languages are becoming popular, specially among unexperienced programmers. 
However, when compared with the static languages there is a huge gap between the functionality of the refactoring tools for dynamic languages and the functionality of the refactoring tools for static languages.
The dynamic languages such as Python or Racket are used in introductory courses around the world and proven to be good languages to learn.
With this lack of refactoring tools for dynamic languages, their increasing popularity and because of the usefulness when teaching programming the need for refactoring tools for dynamic languages grow.
This paper proposes a creation of refactoring tool concerned with unexperienced users, for Racket in DrRacket.
