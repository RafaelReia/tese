Dynamic languages are becoming popular, specially among unexperienced programmers. 
However, when compared with the static languages there is a huge gap between the functionality of the refactoring tools for dynamic languages.
The dynamic languages such as Python or Racket are used in introductory courses around the world and proven to be good languages to learn.
With this lack of refactoring tools for dynamic languages and the increasing popularity of the dynamic languages there is an increasing need of refactoring tools for dynamic languages.
This paper suggests a refactoring tool concerned with unexperienced users, for Racket in DrRacket.
