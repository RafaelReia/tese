% talk about the problem

Refactoring operations are important in order to maintain the quality of the software but because they are error prone and time consuming, refactoring tools are needed.
The objective of this work is to show what exists regarding refactoring tools for dynamic languages, the difference between those tools and tools made for static object oriented languages and propose a refactoring tool designed for unexperienced users.

%Although almost every tool made for static object oriented languages has the refactoring operations for 90\% of the refactoring operations used by the users, but in the best case scenario only 27\% of the refactoring operations were tool assisted.

Although almost every tool made for static languages supports 90\% of the refactoring operations, the users only use refactoring tools for 27\% of the cases. %showing that the major part of the refactoring operations are done manually]

It is shown how few refactoring operations exist in general for dynamic languages and why it is more difficult to make a refactoring tool for dynamic languages.

It also shows the importance of having a refactoring tool concerned about the unexperienced users. 
Besides having dynamic languages as the recommended languages to learn how to program, the dynamic languages are growing. 
And that tool might help the users start to use the refactoring tools and refactoring their programs alongside with programming.

% talk about the solution
The solution uses the informations given by the compiler, namely the AST and the def-use-relation. With this it is possible to create correct refactoring operations necessary for a refactoring tool to unexperienced users.

% talk about what was done
To validate the solution some refactoring operations were already implemented, such as extract-function, add-prefix and rename. However this operations do not cover all the desirable refactoring operations, for example the move expression.

% talk about future work?
In the future, we will add more refactoring operations to the work already done.
