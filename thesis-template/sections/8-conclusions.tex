% talk about the problem

Refactoring operations are important in order to maintain the quality of the software but because they are error prone and time consuming, refactoring tools are needed.
Although almost every tool made for static languages supports 90\% of the refactoring operations, the users only use refactoring tools for 27\% of the cases. 
There is a lack of refactoring tools concerned with unexperienced users, mainly because most of them start programming with dynamic languages and there is a lack of refactoring tools for dynamic languages.
Having a refactoring tool concerned with unexperienced users might help them to start using the refactoring tools and refactoring their programs alongside with programming.

The proposed solution uses the information given by the compiler, namely the AST and the def-use-relation. With this it is possible to create correct refactoring operations necessary for a refactoring tool to unexperienced users.


To validate the solution some refactoring operations were already implemented, such as extract-function, add-prefix and rename. 
So far this architecture is working, however none of the refactoring operations implemented uses the AST and that part remains unvalidated.

% talk about future work?
In the future, will be add more refactoring operations to the work already done.


%Although almost every tool made for static object oriented languages has the refactoring operations for 90\% of the refactoring operations used by the users, but in the best case scenario only 27\% of the refactoring operations were tool assisted.

%showing that the major part of the refactoring operations are done manually]


%It also shows the importance of having a refactoring tool concerned about the unexperienced users. 
%Besides having dynamic languages as the recommended languages to learn how to program, the dynamic languages are growing.
