\section{Evaluation}

%Explain how you are going to show your results (statistical data, cpu performance etc). Answer the following questions:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Why is this solution going to be better than others.
%  \item How am I going to defend that it is better.
%\end{itemize}

In order to evaluate the correctness of the refactoring operations it would be preferable to have a formal proof for each refactoring operation.
However, formal proofs are hard to do and take too much time.
Moreover, formal proofs that exist are usually done for theoretical languages and not for languages actually used, which might explain why even professional refactoring tools such as IntelliJ, Eclipse or NetBeans have errors. \cite{verbaere2006jungl} 

One solution to that problem is to prove correctness informally. 
The proof consists in having several correct Racket programs with unit tests, preferably developed with test-driven-development, then apply some refactoring operations and then run the unit tests again. 
This allows to test if the refactoring operations do not introduce errors in the programs neither change the programs' meaning.

To evaluate the simplicity and usability of the refactoring operations, we will test them by having users following a set of use cases and test the users' response to the tasks.
