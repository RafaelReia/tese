%The atomated ones are used to improve internal software quality by removing the duplication of methods and attributes. However this tools have problems in preserving the understandability.
%There is no current or little practical relevance for full-automated approaches.

{\bf Table.~\ref{tab-Refactoring-Types}} has a summary of each type of refactoring tool and examples of tools of that type.

\subsubsection{Analysis:}
Having the automated refactoring tool for inexperienced users is not what is intended. 
The inexperienced user probably will blindly follow the suggestions which might lead the user to do the wrong refactoring operations.
This is not what we want because the suggestions might be wrong and it might result in a wrong program, or a program with less quality than the original one.
The manual refactoring is not desired either, besides being faster to use a tool, due to the user is inexperienced is way safer to use a tool to apply the refactoring operations. 
inexperienced users tend to do more errors and might forget some changes, thus making a correct program incorrect.

The ideal approach is a Semi-Automated tool that applies what the user wants to do. 
The Semi-Automated tool is safer than using manual refactoring because of the preconditions that it uses to check the correctness of the refactoring operation.
