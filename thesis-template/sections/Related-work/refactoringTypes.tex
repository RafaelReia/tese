The automated refactoring tool because changes the program and the user might be lost after that. %fix this
The automated refactoring tool when used by unexperienced users is not good because, like the Semi-Automated with suggestions might led the user to do the wrong refactoring.
Because it is an unexperienced user, it is highly probable that the user will blindly follow the suggestions given by the tools. 
This is not what we want because the suggestions might be wrong and it might transform in a wrong program or in a program with less quality than the original one.
The manual refactoring is not desired too, besides being faster to use a tool, because the user is unexperienced is way more safer to use a tool to apply the refactoring operations. 
Unexperienced users tend to do more errors and might forgot some changes that put a correct program incorrect.

The ideal approach is a Semi-Automated tool that applies what the user wants to do. 
This tool is safe because of the preconditions and helps the user to learn how to apply refactoring operations instead of blindly follow them.
