\section{Objectives}

%The objectives of this thesis is to implement refactoring operations for inexperienced users.

%To do that it is important to have a language suited to beginners and a pedagogic IDE.

%Refactoring the program using refactoring tools is safer than manually, therefore it prevents introduction of bugs in a previous correct code.
%give example of rename, don not rename all the variables, there is some that are forgotten and stuff

%besides that when programming the inexperienced users tend to create a big function for everything and do not subdivide that function in smaller functions. (extract function refactoring)

The main goal of this thesis is to implement refactoring operations adequate for inexperienced users.
Because it is targeted for inexperienced users it is ideally designed for a language that is used to teach programming in introductory courses, for example Racket or Python.
It is also important to have a pedagogic environment instead of a complex IDE such as Eclipse.
Having a refactoring tool for inexperienced users is important because those users tend to introduce errors in the programs they attempt to modify.
Using a refactoring tool to do the refactoring operation will do a quicker and better job because it is safer than doing it manually.

Those operations must be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Correct
\item Simple to use
\item Useful
\end{itemize}

These characteristics are fundamental to create a refactoring tool targeted for inexperienced users.
