TODO Project Thesis:


Conclusion of the related work

Architecture
	Has a introduction connecting with the Related work conclusion
	AST + def-use-relation (s-exp + "arrows")
	we are "stuck" to the DrRacket so we decided to validate the architecture with some operations, however the architecture might change.
		For each of (extract method, add-prefix, rename-extended)
		add use case
		what was done/used
Evaluation
Evaluate has 2 components
	1st one:
	Evaluation with users in front of the PC
	2nd one:
	Evaluate the correctness of the program
		Formally:
		That is the ideal case, however that is too difficult for complex languages, there are a lot of refactoring tools with bugs, give Jungl's example of eclipse and netbeans(??)!!
		Are usually done for theoretical languages, too much work for real languages
		There are not enough time to do those proves

		informal:
		Have a program with unit tests.
		Do the refactorings
		run again the unit tests

		Use a Racket program that already has unit tests and use that as a good use case!

Conclusion
Wrap up and conclue (I must decide what to write here)

Introduction
Introduce what exist
what are the problems
compare
say the solution really really in the end!

General topic then going to the least general one
talk about the problem
talk about systems talked in the related work
kind of leave a open question
