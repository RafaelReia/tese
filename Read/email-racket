Hi,

I'm trying to do some refactoring operations for DrRacket such as eta-abstraction, 
for the eta-abstraction I need to know where is the function, and the arguments. I can find the function and the arguments if they are variables using the arrows, however if the arguments are literals I do not have any way to find them without manipulating strings.

I would like a mechanism to know what syntax object exist in the position X, for example to know if it is a literal or not.
It is possible to access the information that the check-syntax produces? Can you point me to some documentation or file?

I looked how renaming was implemented and Accessing Check Syntax Programmatically but I did not saw anything related to this.


Best regards,
