FIXME (and) is treated like an if which is bad and give problems
coisas sem ser ands e isso em principio funciona.

TODO => create an syntax object and feed it.
FIXME There is a bug in syntax-walker that for programs with 1 line it does not work.


FIXME => bug while expanding files with classes and stuff. Fix this!

21/09/15 Update: we do not know what calls the online sytax expander, and for
now we can not find a way of passing the information back to the gui.rkt from
the online-comp.rkt / code-walker.rkt. This happens because a new instance is
created of the online-comp.rkt / code-walker.rkt which does not "share" the
values of other instances *duhh*. Having an instance of gui.rkt in
online-comp.rkt / code-walker.rkt does not work either because we can not have 2
instances of the same thing running at the same time.

Possible solutions:
Write to a file
Find out what is calling/starting the handler and get the results from there (??)
 => Use Check Syntax Button


 The last one was chosen because the others failed, either because we wasn't able
 to store syntax objects in a file (in a "small" number of time) or because we
 could not find what is calling that (in a "small" number of time).

 We want to put that working *automatically*, we Have two options:
 Fix the problem
 Automate the "call" to the check syntax button
