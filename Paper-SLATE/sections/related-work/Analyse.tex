It is clear that there is a lack of refactoring tools for dynamic languages, and none of the existent ones cares about unexperienced users that are starting to program.
Racket is a dynamic language that is known of being used as an introductory programming course in schools around the world. Racket also has an IDE, DrRacket that is a pedagogic environmnet \cite{drscheme_pegadogy} and it also supports development and extension of other programming languages \cite{tobin2011languages} and recently it have an implementation of python \cite{ramos2014implementation}.
Besides that DrRacket only has one refactoring operation, that is the rename.
It is needed a refactoring tool that would suit an unexperienced programmer that is learning how to program in order to motivate the unexperienced programmers to start using tool assisted refactoring operations.
