\subsection{Racket}

Racket\footnote{http://racket-lang.org/} is a programming language is a dialect of lisp and a descendant of Scheme and it supports objects, types and laziness evaluation.
For the Racket language the most used IDE is DrRacket. DrRacket is an integrated development environment (IDE), that was formerly known as DrScheme. 
It is a simple IDE that was initially build for Racket programming language and it is aimed at inexperienced programmers.

Regarding refactoring operations DrRacket only has one, namely the rename. 
It could be viewed in two ways, the first is they only implemented one refactoring operation and forgot the other ones, or it could be viewed as they implemented a refactoring operation that is the most used one and in the worst case it represents 29\% of the refactoring operations for experienced users and in the best case represents of 62 to 75\% for the usual users.
