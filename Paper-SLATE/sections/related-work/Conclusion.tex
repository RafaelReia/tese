\subsection{Conclusions}

With this ({\bf Table.~\ref{tab-Comparing-All}}) it is possible to confirm that the refactoring tools for dynamic languages are still far away from the capabilities offered by the refactoring tools for static languages and in average have less refactoring operations than the refactoring tools for static languages.
One advantage of the refactoring tools for dynamic languages is the interoperability, the majority can be used in different text editors whereas the refactoring tools for static languages are made only for one editor.
