%Bicycle Repai Man, refactoring tool python
\subsubsection{Bicycle Repair Man}

 is a Refactoring Tool for Python written in Python and it was based on the ideas of Don Roberts PhD thesis. 
 It is a library that can be added to IDEs and editors to provide refactoring capabilities such as Emacs, Vi, Eclipse, and Sublime Text. 
 However, even having a version for sublime this tool did not improve since 2004.

It is an attempt to create the refactoring browser functionality for Python. 
%Bicycle Repair Man has the following refactoring operations: extract method, extract variable, inline variable, move to module and rename.

The tool has an AST and it does its own parsing so it replaces the Python's parser with its own wrapper to be easier to develop the refactoring operations.
