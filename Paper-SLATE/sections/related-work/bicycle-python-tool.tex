%Bicycle Repai Man, refactoring tool python
\subsection{Bicycle Repair Man}

Bicycle Repair Man, a Refactoring Tool for Python it was based on the ideas of Don Roberts PhD thesis. It is a library that can be added to IDEs and editors to provide refactoring capabilities such as emacs, vi and eclipse, and it also has a version for sublime.
It is an attempt to create refactoring browser functionality for python. 
Bicycle has the following refactoring operations:
extract method
extract variable
inline variable
move to module
rename

It does its parse and it has an AST so it replaces the Python's parser with its own wrapper to be easier to develop the refactoring operations.

However this project did not improved since 2004 and seems dead.
