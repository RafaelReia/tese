\subsection{Refactoring Tool for Samlltalk}%add more?

This refactoring tool \cite{roberts1997refactoring} was made in a browser for smalltalk programs and the goal of this tool was to make refactoring knowed and used for everyone, to quoute them "The goal of our research is to move refactoring into the mainstream of program development. The only way this can occur is to present refactorings to developers in such a way that they cannot help but use them". 
In order to do that they implemented a refactoring browser that needed to do the refactorings faster then the programmers do by hand. 

It was also considered that the user of this tool was intelligent and that automated refactorings would not suit them because, for example, if it was fully-automated the tool would generate new classes in order to eliminate duplicated code, by creating an abstract class. However that new abstracted class could not make sense in the abstraction in the problem domain. Another problem is when the automated refactoring chooses a name for new class. Instead of doing that, the tool points out possible refactorings and let the user decide whether or not to do the refactoring.

This tool uses the reflective features of smalltalk to help doing the analyzes necessary to ensure that the refactorings preserve the behaviour. 
It is used to check the preconditions of each refactoring before execution. However there are some conditions that are more difficult to determine statically, such as dynamic typing and cardinality relationships between objects, the tool uses another approach, instead of checking the precondition statically, the preconditions are checked dynamically. 
This is done using method wrappers to collect run-time information, the Refactoring Browser does the refactoring and then add a wrapper method to the original method and then, as the program runs the wrapper detects the source code that called the original method.
One example of this is the rename method. After applying the refactoring and during the program run, when the old method is called, the browser suspends the execution and go to the location of the code that called the old method and changes that to the new method. One problem of this approach is that the dynamically analysis is only good as the test suit used.
