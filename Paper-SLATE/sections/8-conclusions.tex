\section{Conclusions}

%refactoring is used a lot
%BUT tools are underused.
% lack of dynamic refactoring tools and operations when compared with static object oriented ones. some of that exist are dead.
% Intention of creating a tool for unexperienced users to start doing refactoring operations with the tool.


Refactoring operations are important in order to maintain the quality of the software and because they are error prone and time consuming refactoring tools are needed.
The objective of this overview is to show what exist regarding refactoring tools for dynamic languages and the difference between those tools and tools made for static object oriented languages.

Apart from almost  every tool made for static object oriented languages have the refactoring operations for 90\% of the refactorings done but in the best case scenario only 27\% of the refactoring operations were tool assisted.

It also shows how less refactoring operations exist in general for dynamic languages and why it is more difficult to make a refactoring tool for dynamic languages.

In conclusion this paper to show the importance of having a refactoring tool concerned in the unexperienced users. Besides having dynamic tools as the recommended languages to learn how to program, the dynamic languages are growing. By having such tool made for with that concern it might help the users start using the refactoring tools and refactoring their programs alongside with programming.

%and to show the need of a refactoring tool for dynamic languages targeted for unexperienced programmers
