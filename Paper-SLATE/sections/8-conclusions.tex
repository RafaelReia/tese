\section{Conclusions}

%refactoring is used a lot
%BUT tools are underused.
% lack of dynamic refactoring tools and operations when compared with static object oriented ones. some of that exist are dead.
% Intention of creating a tool for unexperienced users to start doing refactoring operations with the tool.


In this paper it is shown that refactoring operations are important and they are used a lot, however the tool supported refactoring is underused and that is a issue because it is consensual that tool support is important to the refactoring operations by reducing the time spent and errors induced.

The difference of refactoring operations and support available to static object oriented languages when compared with dynamic ones is huge. The dynamic languages are growing fast and are the recommended  languages used to learn how to program.

The intention of creating a tool to refactoring operations aimed at unexperienced users for a dynamic languages inserts in a not so much explored area. By having a refactoring tool that cares about unexperienced users it might help the users start using tool support to their refactoring operations and lower the time spend doing those and the errors added.
