Add Prefix Use Case

A programmer is using some functions from a library and then realizes that needs another library. when importing that library conflicts occur.
both libraries have function with the same name. The solution add a prefix for one of the requires.
That is really annoying because the user has to remember and change one by one all functions invocations.

The Add Prefix refactoring does all that for the user.

This is also useful when the name of the functions are similar, adding a prefix make it easier to distinguish between libraries.
